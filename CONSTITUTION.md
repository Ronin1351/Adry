# Development Constitution

## Code Quality Principles

### 1. Strong Typing & Type Safety
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enable strict mode for maximum type safety
- **Strong Typing**: All variables, functions, and components must be properly typed
- **No `any` Types**: Avoid `any` types; use proper type definitions or `unknown`
- **Type Guards**: Use type guards for runtime type checking
- **Generic Types**: Leverage generics for reusable, type-safe components

### 2. Clean Code Standards
- **Small Components**: Keep components under 200 lines; split into smaller, focused components
- **Documented Components**: Every component must have JSDoc comments explaining purpose and props
- **No Dead Code**: Remove unused imports, functions, and components immediately
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, class, and module should have one clear purpose
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - extract common functionality into reusable components
- **Consistent Formatting**: Use Prettier and ESLint for consistent code style

### 2. Code Organization
- **Modular Architecture**: Break code into logical, reusable modules
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate business logic, data access, and presentation layers
- **File Naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions (camelCase for functions, PascalCase for components)
- **Folder Structure**: Organize files by feature/domain, not by file type
- **Import/Export Management**: Use explicit imports and avoid circular dependencies

### 3. Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests for Logic**: All business logic, utility functions, and custom hooks must have unit tests
- **E2E Tests for Flows**: Critical user flows must have end-to-end tests
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain minimum 80% code coverage for critical business logic

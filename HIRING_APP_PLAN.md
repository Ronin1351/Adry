## Payment System

### Stripe Integration
- **Subscription Model**: ₱600 every 3 months

- **Invoice Management**: Automatic invoice generation and email delivery

### Payment Flow
1. Employer clicks "Message Candidate" button
2. Check if active subscription exists
3. If no subscription, redirect to payment page
4. Process payment through Stripe
5. Activate messaging features
6. Send confirmation email

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration
- Refresh tokens with 7-day expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with Prisma
- XSS protection with Content Security Policy
- CSRF protection with tokens
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### File Upload Security
- Image validation and compression
- Virus scanning for uploaded files
- Secure file storage with signed URLs
- File size and type restrictions

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Performance
- Code splitting with React.lazy()
- Image optimization with next/image
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Service worker for caching
- CDN for static assets

### Backend Performance
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Redis caching for session data
- API response compression
- Connection pooling for database
- Background job processing

### Database Optimization
